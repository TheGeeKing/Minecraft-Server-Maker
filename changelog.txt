Minecraft Server Maker - Changelog

TODO:
- Possibility to update/modify the start.bat file and server.properties file of an already existing server.
- Check that the custom java path can run the server (issue: if the exe has no version details, the actual behaviour is that the exe is not taken into account in the check_java function).

v2.0:

Added:
- Custom Java path now have a file browse button to select the executable. Input and file browse button have tooltip.
- Added text to track the progress of the server creation.
- If you click on "OK" in the "Server created!" window, the server folder will open.
- If Java is not installed or outdated, the program will now ask you if you want to download it and if yes, it will open your browser and redirect you.

Changed:
- Check if Java is installed differently, now using `where java` command and check if the latest version found is okay for the minecraft version chosen.
- If no Java is found, start.bat will be created with 'Java' as the executable argument.

Fixed:
- If java wasn't installed subprocess.run() was raising an error and causing the 'Creating server' window to never close.
- Now correctly inform the user that java is not installed or the version is not compatible.
- Progress window now uses less cpu ressources.
- Adds quotes around the path of Java so start.bat correctly works.

Other:
- Added a proper README file.
- Added a changelog file.
